= Installation

Simply install the gem and dependencies.

    $ gem install showoff

To use the development version you should clone the repository and build the gem manually instead.

    $ git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/showoff.git
    $ cd showoff
    $ gem build showoff.gemspec
    $ sudo gem install ./showoff-*.gem

Showoff is tested with Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.3, and 2.0. It should install cleanly on these versions.
